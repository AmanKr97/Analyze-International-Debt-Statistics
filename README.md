<h3 align="left">Problem Statement :</h3>
It's not that we humans only take debts to manage our necessities. A country may also
take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly
ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. The World Bank is
the organization that provides debt to countries.
In this project, you are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World
Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by
developing countries across several categories. You are going to find the answers to

- What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the
dataset?

- Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount
look like?

- What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt
indicators?

The data used in this project is provided by The World Bank. It contains both national
and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970
to 2015.
